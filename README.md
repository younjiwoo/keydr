#### Overview
KeyDR is a musical game for one player. The user has to press the keys(D, F, J and K) that match the notes coming down the screen, similar to DDR or Guitar Hero. If the player who succeeds in finishing the song has the top 3 highest score, their score gets recorded.

## Technologies I used:

Ruby-on-Rails back-end with Postgresql database, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery used in the front-end. ( Ruby version 2.4.0 | Ruby on Rails version: 5.1.2 )

## Installation
You can simply download the app, run `bundle install`, run the `rails server`, and then access to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
